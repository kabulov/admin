So we want to allow unlim or more than 2 simultaneous rdp connections to a host.
Host is 'windows server 2008 r2'. 

Usually one goes to 'tsconfig.msc' (..windows\system32\)
and there under 'connections', in 'properties', in 'network adapter' tab
'maximum connections' is 2, if no 'RD Session Host Role Service' has been installed.

So we have to install 'RD Session Host Role Service'.
for this we go to 'servermanager.msc' (..windows\system32),
there we add a role 'Remote Desktop Services',
role services set to 'remote desktop session host',
set 'do not require network level authentication',
and in 'properties', we set 'licencing mode' to 'per device',
manage groups and users, then install and reboot,
then we should cpecify 'licence server' - add one and done.
then usually 'maximum connections' is unlim.

that`s it.
