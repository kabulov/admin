so i had to make changes to 1010 line of 
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/buildbot/steps/source/oldsource.py:1019

/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/buildbot/steps/source/oldsource.py:957
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/buildbot/steps/source/oldsource.py:958
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/buildbot/steps/source/oldsource.py:993
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/buildbot/steps/source/oldsource.py:994

Now solved: one has to change these last 4 lines to make hg pull from
repo one wants !!
