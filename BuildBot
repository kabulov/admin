Overall:

1. process 
-software is being created 
-there is a piece of software
-revision control system is used to keep track of changes in software(git, mercurial, ...)
-changes are made to some parts of the code base
-now, software has to be rebuild 
-which means:
--pull from repository
--create build directory
--run cmake
--compile
--run tests

2. automation
-we really wouldn`t like to do things described above manually
-especially when the system is large
-here comes automation !
-automate means:
--scheduler (to schedule tasks: pull, build, run tests, report)
--builders (list of commands to build a piece of software from a piece of code and run tests)
--buildslaves (a platform to build and run tests on)

3. configs
on server
-master.cfg
-repo itself
-hgserver config
-apache config
on buildslave
-/home/buildbot (e.g. buildbot.tac - admin)

4. layout
server : nightly, forced, homedir, repo, ip and port, builders, urls, notify
-scheduler
buildslave : tests, execution dirs, build dirs, pull dirs
-super slave
-win slave
-lin slave

5. execution order
-cron(or force)
-scheduler(described in master.cfg)
-builder
-buildslave
-scripts : hg pull(mercurial), cmake, compile(visual studio), run tests(python)
